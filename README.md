This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native's AsyncStorage: improper error handling and data serialization. The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file showcases the flawed implementation that can lead to unexpected crashes or data corruption.  The `AsyncStorageSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that employs robust error handling and JSON serialization for data integrity.
